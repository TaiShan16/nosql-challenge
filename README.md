# nosql-challenge
In this project we work with the data on various establishments across the United Kingdom. In part I, we import json file to Jupyter notebook and create a database name uk_food in MongoDB. In the 2nd part, we updated the database with the new restaurants, and removed all restaurants in Dover area. In part 3, we perform analysis by using count_documents and display the resutl using pprint.
